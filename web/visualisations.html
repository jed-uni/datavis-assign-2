	<h1>What causes higher alcohol consumption rates?</h1>
    <p>Is it possible that there is more to it than just culture?</p>

    	<h1>What does this mean?</h1>
        <p>For now, we can see that most countries are quite varied, but generally lie between the 6 and 10 litres per 100,000 people mark, with a few notable outliers. Bellow, a comparison of the two outliers, <em>Russia</em> (10.8 at 2019) and <em>Turkey</em> (1.3), and the median <em>New Zealand</em> (8.8)</p>

        <h1>What does this mean?</h1>
        <p>Despite the fact that Turkey has the lowest alcohol consumption rate, New Zealand still has 3 1/2 more years in life expectency than Russia in 2019. However, we do see that Russia has a significantly larger gap (~9 years) between New Zealand, or ~5 1/2 years behind Turkey.
        <p>Perhaps it could be described that countries with significantly greater alcohol consumption than other countries has lower lifespans?</p>
