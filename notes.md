# Data Visualisation Assignment

## FAQ and extra info

> You MUST use the OECD health dataset (anything from them)

 You are marked on the iteration of the design process

> You can use any story to create a visualisation for

## Book

### Title Page

- Big, bold title
- Name, and student id,
- Add a graphic
    - Must reference where graphic was found
- Add website link

### Table of Contents

- Use heading styles
- Use automatically generating table of contents
    - DO NOT manually create it, it might not end up looking good
- Make it easier to navigate document

### Introduction

#### Background Modivation

- Give reader understanding on what the background topic is
- What they need to understand and why the visualisation is important

#### Project Objectives / Visual Purpose

- What questions will the visualisation answer

### Data

> Show the reader you are confident in handling the data
- Include:
    - Source
    - Data Processing (SQL, python, etc)
    - Data types and encoding options
    - Data transformations
- Add screenshots of excel spreadsheets
- For everything that you modify in the dataset, explain **how** it is generated before it's used in the visualisation
- Add a table for all attributes in the dataset, with a description and type
    - Type = categorical, text, numerical, etc

### Visualisation Design

> Demonstrate the design process

- Low fidelity prototyping / sketches
- Iteration
- Use of design guidelines
- At least try to use other chart design 
    - You won't have to use them, just demonstrate that you know them
- Include advantages/disadvantages

### Website

## Visualisation Examples

### Interactive Design

https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-who-marries-whom/

- Displays what occupations marry what occupations
- Example of **brushing**
- Instead of searching through tabs, you just hover your mouse over everything

- Variables:
    - Proposed spending
    - % to cut / increase from 2012

- Hue / Colour
    - Colour shows amount of cut/increase from 2012
    - Red = cut
    - Green = Increase
    - It is clear which is an increase and decrease because it isn't a rainbow because of **saturation**

- Main Visualisation
    - Circles shows amount of spending
    - Hovering over them shows their actual values
    - Arranged from increased spending, to biggest cuts

- Second Visualisation (Types of spending)
    - Splits up the mandatory and discretionary spneding
    - Animation between the two

- Third Visualisation (Changes)
    - Shows changes to discretionary spending
    - Showing more clearly where gains/loses are
    - Outliers are more evident
    - Organised by the industry - It is **not** labeled correctly 

- Fourth Visualisation
    - Categorises each spending category into industries
    - Can compare spending between industries, and between categories in industries together
    - Most useful
